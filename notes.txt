We checked for a build failure in the CI itself and filed an issue in the CI cycle.
This way we avoided creating an issue after pushing the failed docker image(build failures) to staging slo,t

- POI-CI.yml
- make a code change
- Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request
- Create a pull request
- wait for the build to be completed
- Merge the pull request, Confirm merge
- This invokes poi-cd.yml

==
To introduce a build failure

- make a code change api/poi/...
- repeat from #4 to #7
